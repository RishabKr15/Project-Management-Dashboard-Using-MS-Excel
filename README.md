📊 Project Management Dashboard
📝 Overview
Managing projects or tasks can be significantly improved with a visual representation of progress and milestones. This Excel-based Project Management Dashboard provides a structured way to track tasks, budgets, and overall project performance, helping teams stay on schedule and within budget.
I have used several techniques to build this Excel project management dashboard:
* Excel Tables
* PivotTables
* COUNTIF and COUNTIFS functions
* GETPIVOTDATA function
* WORKDAY.INTL function
* WEEKDAY function
* Excel Charts
* Slicers
* TEXT function
* Form Controls
* SEQUENCE function
* Conditional Formatting Data Bars
* Conditional Formatting with Formulas
* Custom Number Formats
